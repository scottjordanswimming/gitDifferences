# What Are the Differences Between `git push`, `git pull`, and `git fetch`?

The main difference between the git push, git pull, and git fetch commands is the way they handle changes in the remote repository.

- `git push` sends changes from a local branch to a remote repository. It updates the remote branch with the commits from the local branch.
- `git fetch` retrieves changes from a remote repository into a tracking branch, but it does not merge those changes into the local branch. To incorporate the changes, you must make a separate `git merge` command.
- `git pull` combines the functionality of `git fetch` and `git merge`. It retrieves changes from the remote repository into a tracking branch and then immediately merges them into the local branch. This command is often used when you want to quickly update your local branch with the latest changes from the remote repository.
